\title{Download daily prism data}
\usage{
get_prism_dailys(type, minDate = NULL, maxDate = NULL, dates = NULL,
  keepZip = TRUE, check = "httr")
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{The type of data to download, must be "ppt", "tmean", "tmin", or "tmax".
Note that tmean == mean(tmin, tmax).}

\item{minDate}{a valid iso-8601 (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD) date to start to download data.}

\item{maxDate}{a valid iso-8601 (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD) date to end downloading data.}

\item{dates}{a vector of iso-8601 formatted dates to download data for, can also be a single date.}

\item{keepZip}{if \code{TRUE}, leave the downloaded zip files in your 'prism.path', if \code{FALSE}, they will be deleted.}

\item{check}{One of "httr" or "internal". "httr", the default, checks the file name using the web
service, and downloads if that file name is not in the file system. "internal" (much faster) 
only attempts to download layers that are not already in the file system as stable. "internal"
should be used with caution as it is not robust to changes in version or file names.}

\description{
Download daily data from the prism project at 4km grid cell resolution for precipitation, mean, min and max temperature
}
\details{
Dates must be in the proper format or downloading will not work properly, you can either enter a date range via minDate and maxDate, or a vector of dates, but not both. You must make sure that you have set up a valid download directory.  This must be set as options(prism.path = "YOURPATH")
get_prism_dailys(type="tmean", minDate = "2013-06-01", maxDate = "2013-06-14", keepZip=FALSE)
