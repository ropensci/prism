}
\arguments{
\item{type}{The type of data to download, must be "ppt", "tmean", "tmin", or "tmax".
Note that tmean == mean(tmin, tmax).}

\item{years}{a valid numeric years, or vector of years,
to download data for. If no month is specified, years
averages for that years will be downloaded}

}
\description{
Download monthly data from the prism project
at 4km grid cell resolution for precipitation, mean, min, and max temperature
}
\details{
Data is available from 1891 until 2014, however you have to download all
data for years prior to 1981.
Therefore if you enter a vector of years that bounds 1981,
you will automatically download all data for all years in the vector.
If the "all" parameter is set to TRUE, it will override any mon
entered and download all data. Data will be downloaded for all mon
in all the years in the vectors supplied. You must make sure
that you have set up a valid download directory.
This must be set as options(prism.path = "YOURPATH")
}
